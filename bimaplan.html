								<div><h5>PRoduct Research & Design</h5></div>
								<div style="padding-bottom:30px">"BimaPlan is an innovative insurance product that aims to increase insurance penetration in underserved markets. As a self-taught, data-driven designer with a passion for human-centered solutions, I took on the challenge of designing the user experience for BimaPlan. This case study delves into the design process, explores the obstacles encountered, and highlights the product's impact on making insurance more accessible to a broader audience. </div>

							<div style="padding-bottom:10px"><h4>The Job to Be Done</h4></div>
							<div>BimaPlan caters to three main user personas with distinct needs:

1. **Independent Agent**: Seeking additional income by selling insurance policies to customers in underserved markets.
2. **Partner Agent**: Incentivized to cross-sell BimaPlan insurance policies to their existing users/customers through strategic partnerships.
3. **Customers**: Looking for an insurance policy to protect their and their family's economic well-being against unforeseen risks.</div>
						</div>
						<div class="span_10_of_10">
							<div style="padding-bottom:10px"><h4>Product Hypothesis</h4></div>
							<div>BimaPlan's design is rooted in three core beliefs:

1. With a seamless digital experience, agents can be onboarded and trained to effectively sell insurance policies online, improving their understanding of available policies.
2. Providing the right incentives motivates agents to sell insurance actively, leading to sustained interest in their work.
3. A reward and recognition program encourages agents to refer potential sellers, ultimately boosting sales.</div>

							<div style="padding-bottom:10px"><h4>Research</h4></div>
							<div></div>
						</div>
						<div class="span_10_of_10">
							<div style="padding-bottom:10px"><h4>Biggest Question</h4></div>
							<div>How can we design an insurance platform that simplifies the policy buying process for customers in underserved rural and urban communities, while also incentivizing and enabling agents to actively promote and sell policies effectively?</div>
						</div>
						<div class="span_10_of_10">
							<div style="padding-bottom:10px"><h4>The Hypothesis</h4></div>
							<div>By conducting extensive user research across diverse demographics in underserved areas, we can uncover the specific challenges faced by potential customers and agents in accessing, understanding, and selling insurance products. This will inform the design of an inclusive, user-friendly platform with features that educate, motivate, and facilitate the insurance buying/selling process for all stakeholders.</div>
